  <p>“I did something super awesome!” - Tushar</p>

<p>“Oh really? Oh let me guess… you managed to overcome your fear of bugs and now you are no longer scared of bugs. Is that correct big man?” - Diary</p>

<p>“OMG STOP JUDGING ME! THE BUG LOOKED REALLY FREAKING SCARY!!!!!” - Tushar <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/gkLhGv1yNEYFlf49qO/giphy.gif">*<em>cries internally</em>*</a></p>

<p>But really, the last few days have been pretty awesome for me because I got to go on a vacation with Yue. She is a trooper. She organized the whole vacation for us and I LOVED every single moment of it. Yes, even when I couldn’t swim in the super cold water. Yue and I kayaked and paddle boarded. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdVarbhugUBQOeA/giphy.gif">Paddle boarding</a> was super scary even with a life jacket because the river was suuuuuuper deep. We went to a super nice restaurant (where a scary looking bug landed on my plate and I got freaked out while Yue handled it like a pro and make me look like a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/HtYsYjPsw1nVu/giphy.gif">bitch</a> in front of everyone else) and saw a family of deer. We ate some ice cream and cheesecake too! I am sure I am forgetting a few <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/DOotiImlZCPQs/giphy.gif">wisps</a> of details that will congeal in a pool somewhere. The only downside was that our vacation was cut short because of some unforeseen circumstances and that is definitely not fair to Yue. So Yue, I hope you take this <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/RWUqVYucDBD4A/giphy.gif">gif</a> as my apology.</p>
