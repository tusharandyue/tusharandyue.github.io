  <p>“I did something super awesome!” - Tushar</p>

<p>“Oh really? Oh let me guess… you managed to overcome your fear of bugs and now you are no longer scared of bugs. Is that correct big man?” - Diary</p>

<p>“OMG STOP JUDGING ME! THE BUG LOOKED REALLY FREAKING SCARY!!!!!” - Tushar <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/gkLhGv1yNEYFlf49qO/giphy.gif">*<em>cries internally</em>*</a></p>

<p>But really, the last few days have been pretty awesome for me because I got to go on a vacation with Yue. She is a trooper. She organized the whole vacation for us and I LOVED every single moment of it. Yes, even when I couldn’t swim in the super cold water. Yue and I kayaked and paddle boarded. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdVarbhugUBQOeA/giphy.gif">Paddle boarding</a> was super scary even with a life jacket because the river was suuuuuuper deep. We went to a super nice restaurant (where a scary looking bug landed on my plate and I got freaked out while Yue handled it like a pro and make me look like a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/HtYsYjPsw1nVu/giphy.gif">bitch</a> in front of everyone else) and saw a family of deer. We ate some ice cream and cheesecake too! I am sure I am forgetting a few <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/DOotiImlZCPQs/giphy.gif">wisps</a> of details that will congeal in a pool somewhere. The only downside was that our vacation was cut short because of some unforeseen circumstances and that is definitely not fair to Yue. So Yue, I hope you take this <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/RWUqVYucDBD4A/giphy.gif">gif</a> as my apology.</p>

  <p>Today we went to my favorite restaurant in Houston so far (well it’s technically a cafe inside a temple, but <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/M31G94ayUWQpO/giphy.gif">whatever…</a>. I set a personal goal to not go this place until December so I would give myself 1 full year of <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/pnXn2WHCTI9nW/giphy.gif">extreme</a> (you&rsquo;re welcome Yue) diet and exercise before I would even consider eating like a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/GI1kfuiI4Tzgc/giphy.gif">horse</a> again.</p>

<p>Well I didn’t reach that goal. I am not sad at all. I kind of needed this at this point in time. Maybe I should consider allowing myself some cheat days in order to not go crazy.</p>

<p>It is natural for one to eat like a goddamn <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aTaAgUK1qcv1WE/giphy.gif">gorilla</a> when one goes to Indian restaurant. Naturally… <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/E9MPdMW3bJtle/giphy.gif">Well that’s exactly what Yue and I did.</a></p>

<p>And oh, the best part was that we saw movies all day long. This is basically the best day for the secret <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/Ms3ybgCq8NvdC/giphy.gif">fatass</a> Tushar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>And they going gorillas, huh!</em></p>

<p><em>No one knows what it means, but it&rsquo;s provocative</em></p>

<p>Anyways, I am glad he is part of Yue’s and my life. He is a little shithead, but he is my little shithead.</p>

  <time datetime="2019-02-24T00:00:00Z" class="post-date">Sun, Feb 24, 2019</time>
  <p>Today I went my first official fancy ballet dressed super <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/LOy47Su8Mx7uE/giphy.gif">fancy</a> (with whatever clothes I have in my closet). The ballet was performed in a gorgeous building with giant sculptures inside of it. The whole ceiling was shiny and our seats were REALLY high to the point that I was legitimately afraid I was going to fall. Thank God for Yue - she told me to don’t be a pussy, and be a man (I may or may not have made that part up). The ballet was easy to follow most of the times and it helped me tremendously that Yue was explaining me a lot of the things. The guide I read before the show began was nicely designed too. I am really really glad that Yue took the initiative to take me to the ballet. I am sure she loved the whole experience too. I just wish I was a bit richer to do this more often and wear a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/nADclROyPirtK/giphy.gif">suit</a>.</p>

<p>ps. I wanted to bring <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/1yIOP7uri46SQ/giphy.gif">Yoda</a> to the ballet. But it would lead to a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdvdkSja6nXmOoqA/giphy.gif">disaster</a>!</p>

<p>pps. I was <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oAt21Fnr4i54uK8vK/giphy.gif">disappointed</a> that the ballet dancers weren’t covered in <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/K15sV0WWFUE9y/giphy.gif">gold leaf</a>. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o75225lIkdm2SvSco/giphy.gif">I want my money back!</a></p>

  <p>Yue and I spent this weekend celebrating <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752obYVRjAcJ4vsc/giphy.gif">Valentine’s Day</a>. I cooked up some pasta and some dessert that I was pretty proud of. The best part of the whole night was when Yue presented me with a very moving note on the back of a photo collage she made. I wasn’t surprised at all. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2tmyH06o86kLqU/giphy.gif">That’s why I love her.</a></p>

<p>I want to say, I am VERY happy when I am with Yue. Recently, we have been trying out a sort of new schedule that gives me more time to spend at home on the weekends so I can finish my tasks before the week officially begins. I like that change. It allows me to focus on important things like studying and going to gym rather than things like ironing or meal prep during weekdays.</p>

<p>I also got into a small car accident right near Yue’s apartment. When I told her this, she came rushing out and spent some time with me. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l49JFIqAYshRSD6tq/giphy.gif">I AM SO GLAD SHE IS WITH ME!</a></p>

<p>ps. I am so sorry that I was an hour late to the Lunar New Year celebration event. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohc1ffY03hnhRUyUU/giphy.gif">Plz forgive.</a></p>

<p>pps. It has been a full year since I started keeping this journal. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/8PBfNDoySmsRc49P4F/giphy.gif">Yay me!</a></p>

  <p>UGH… I am deciding to be healthy and go to gym and wake up at 5AM and have a breakfast and <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/2yyiMaap8tJio1o9mn/giphy.gif">yada yada yada…</a> Let’s see how long I can keep this up. I signed up for a gym membership at LA Fitness, took Yue there a few times now, and I think she enjoys it… mostly… She gets bored pretty easily. She sometimes offers me unhealthy food, that I am refusing. I gotta say, I feel pretty great when I have the power to refuse junk food.</p>

<p>I got into a small car accident, and Yue has been driving me everywhere, and I am so grateful to have a girlfriend like her! She picked me up from my place and then she went to the gym with me. I am truly blessed.</p>

<p>And Yoda… Well, he has been through some tough times. He got <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o751ZSp5YXQltPGlG/giphy.gif">cat cold</a> (I don&rsquo;t know why I am saying &ldquo;cat cold&rdquo;&hellip; I should just say &ldquo;cold&rdquo;&hellip;), got his <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/10FHR5A4cXqVrO/giphy.gif">toe infected</a>, <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZfnuAbefMycfu/giphy.gif">became super nice</a>, went to the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/LbGtuww7ZFhgQ/giphy.gif">vet</a>, <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/26gsfdArwyEnXnDGw/giphy.gif">and got better</a>. I have to say, he was acting like my ideal cat (super cuddly) when he was sick. I felt guilty calling him a “little shithead” :) With pain meds and antibiotics, he started getting better. So it’s back to calling him a “little shithead”&hellip; well, because he starting to go back to this baseline and is now acting like a shithead. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oAt21Fnr4i54uK8vK/giphy.gif">Sad&hellip;</a></p>

  <p>So Yue got back to Houston earlier than expected: on the NYE at 11pm. That meant we spent the NYE together… inside the apartment… eating some leftover food that I made. I was very happy to do that because I got to do it with Yue. TBH, I was very surprised when Yue told me that her flight was moved up and I excited the whole day! We shared a midnight kiss, and watched the 1st episode of <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iy4vh0fIqMXTgu4/giphy.gif">This Is Us</a>.</p>

<p>Yoda on the other hand, is acting a little sluggish and I am noticing a red bump on his left <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/GxN4ics7OlvsA/giphy.gif">foot?hand?</a> I think it’s infected. Yue is going to take him to the vet and hopefully get some antibiotics. And oh, almost forgot, I did the whole surprise thing to Yue and she <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/11Un64tF2yX8JO/giphy.gif">OBVIOUSLY started crying</a> .</p>

  <p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/kFku8NDzYI9ZU26QXJ/giphy.gif">Hi bud</a>, how long has it been? Like 7 freaking months! Well, I have been a little busy, but mostly I just forgot about writing in you. Basically, Yue and I broke up for a while, but then we got back together. That’s a super short summary of what happened that you are privy to. The reason I am writing this very special entry here is because I am finally done with the website I am making for Yue. She has no idea that I am doing anything remotely close to this. She is currently in Hawaii, while I am with my family finishing up this little project that took FAR TOO LONG for me to finish. Funny thing is that while she has been sending these really amazing, well-crafted (love) letters, I have been responding with “K,” and basically saying “I am no good with words.” Hopefully, this should surprise her. The plan is to write a letter, somehow explaining my love for her, and giving her the gift of this diary, and a key to my apartment. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/rXliavIYbs60o/giphy.gif">Wish me luck!</a></p>

  <p>I have been living with Yue for about a month now at her place. Our school vacation started on the 14th and since then we have been having a lot of fun! We went to Crystal Beach and <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/5LU6ZcEGBbhVS/giphy.gif">took Yoda to the vet</a>. We shopped around for a new phone at the Verizon store and Yue got a brand new phone!!! Unfortunately, I had a fight with my parents about Yue. I will spare you the details, because I don’t want this diary to have anything to do with my overall relationship status. Needless to say, things are going to be rocky for a while. I may take a break from writing in this diary. I may come back.</p>

  <p>So today I found out that Yoda can sleep in bed with Yue… if he feels like it… Basically this little shithead annoys the crap out of me when we try to take a nap. He runs around and makes a lot of noise. Little shithead thinks it’s so much fun to play with the blinds when his parents are trying to sleep. I am sure he enjoys annoying us. We are the most important people in his life: we feed him, clean up after his shit and vomit, take him to the vet, give him medications, play with him, basically we serve his ass all day long. And do you know how he rewards us? BY NOT LETTING ME NAP WHEN I REALLY NEED TO NAP AND I ONLY HAVE LIKE 15 MINUTES TO NAP. But hey, if you are nice to him, and if he feels like it, he will cuddle with Yue and sleep in the bed and let me take a nap quietly. Thanks for nothing <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/iviU5Hwac8f04/giphy.gif">asshole</a>!</p>

  <p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0EoAl1ECVSSWuwr6/giphy.gif">So we are officially a couple now</a>. Why do you ask? Because we got in an argument about the silliest thing today. It was about overusing the diswasher for smallest number of dishes. My family does not use dishwashers. Yue, on the other hand, typically uses dishwasher pretty frequently. So we ended up fighting about how Yue was not able to handle any difficulties in life and would choose the more comforting option, even if it costs her money. I honestly don’t think the whole issue was worth fighting about, but that’s what fights are typically about: trivial things. In the end, I felt pretty bad for the whole encounter. Lesson learned. Moving on.</p>

I would not mind doing this for the rest of my life with her. The best part of this is that she told me today she felt like we were a couple. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/YKcWT7DvtwVVu/giphy.gif">Awww</a> 😀</p>

  <p>Today, Yue and I  went shopping at Burlington coat factory and I loved it! I hope Yue loved it too, but we haven’t developed telepathic mind-melding communication yet. We ended up buying a lot of <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/hnl83xVQxpqJG/giphy.gif">clothes</a>. Yue helped me pick out some shirts and pants, and I gotta say, she has a good sense of fashion. I like shopping with her.</p>

  <p>OK, so I made her cry again. What a fool! I honestly didn’t mean to, but it just happened. I was joking around too much this time. Rather than going into too many details, all I am going to say is that I need to be mindful of her limits. I feel pretty crummy.</p>

  <p>So this is awkward. Today, I made Yue cry. I didn’t mean to… it just… sort of happened. It happened because I was pressuring Yue to call her doctor’s office to get results of her tests back. I find that Yue is opposite of millenials - she never feels entitled to anything. I, on the other hand, want things done in a timely fashion, and I get a little flustered if other people aren’t doing their job right (yeah, I know, I would be a horrible boss). So anyways, long story short, I wanted her to stand up for herself, but I was too aggressive. That made her feel uncomfortable and she started crying.</p>

  <p>Today we found out we passed our classes. I was really happy. Yue was really <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/hZj44bR9FVI3K/giphy.gif">happy</a>!</p>

  <p>Today, we went to see Rodeo with Pressida. It was a lot of fun; too loud and too extreme, just like the people watching it 😀. But the most important part of today was the fact that I cooked <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/t8t3VPvJEBVxC/giphy.gif">steak</a> for her. I have been watching a lot of videos on youtube about how to cook steak, and today was the day I tried all of that out. We went to my place (yes, I cooked steak in my place…), and I cooked a rather below average and well done steak. I tried a little piece of it, and I wasn’t impressed by it. But Yue thought it was pretty good. She got so excited that she shared the pics with Ting and Ruixue. I am just glad I was able to make her happy!</p>

  <p>Yue’s <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/xThuWkj1FAYH4wmGfC/giphy.gif">birthday</a> celebration continues today. I am not going to lie, this is quite possibly the best weekend I have ever had. And it’s all made possible by Yue. We went to Galveston beach, parked my car illegally on the sand while worrying heavily about whether my tiny little Civic would be able to get out of the sand. It did… so that’s a good news! <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/BdUFU1x33ugla/giphy.gif">I love Honda</a>. And btw, this was my very first visit to an actual beach. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdv7Nd456OCovaaA/giphy.gif">LIKE A REAL FREAKING BEACH WITH LOTS OF BLUE STUFF</a>! I was quite excited. Yue took some videos of me acting like a fool. I am glad she did that. We had some lunch at Gypsey Joynt. It was a pretty nice place with pretty nice food. And while making our way back, we decided to visit Zone D&rsquo;Erotica. It was a pretty bad store. We made some jokes here and there, but most of the time, I was thinking about the finances of this store (how did this store make any money??). What surprised me the most was the fact that Yue was super adventurous. She was completely OK with visiting this place. I would have never imagined her doing that. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/5p2wQFyu8GsFO/giphy.gif">Never have I been glad to be wrong.</a></p>

  <p>So today is Yue’s <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/yoJC2GnSClbPOkV0eA/giphy.gif">birthday</a>. We have talked about what to do during this weekend for a while now. Our day today was filled with lots and lots of activities that I, alone, would never do all of them in one week. So that’s saying something. We went to the arboretum and hiked there and shared a tender moment. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif">Well, a few tender moments</a>. We went to the mall too! Walking at the Galleria with Yue is so much fun! She is one of those people who likes trying new things and is really flexible, so I can easily go into any shop I want. For dinner, we went to 99 ranch too. And oh, we watched Black Panther. What a busy day!</p>

  <p>Lovely weather. Lovelier company all day from Yue. It was a very relaxing and focused study session, right after a bit of fun 😀. Yoda behaved nicely and I can tell Yue really appreciates me training him. Well she told me that directly, so <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/TtjTmZWrQ4EM/giphy.gif">I am no Sherlock</a>. And oh, we passed CMD and that&rsquo;s a cause for celebration. Term is almost over. Yue&rsquo;s birthday is almost here. Never have I been looking forward to break than this term.</p>

  <p>Oh boy. This day&hellip; This day was pretty much the same as yesterday, with me freaking out, and Yue working her <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif">magic</a> on me. Would I have survived PA school without her? Definitely yes. Would I also experience crippling anxiety, GERD, and PUD? Definitely yes. The good thing is that the hard tests are behind us, and yes, we are preparing for the possibility of remediating the anatomy course. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/6UpQJVXTiOGuA/giphy.gif">Side note, she is a great patient to do a physical exam</a>. Very detail oriented. And she gets a little jealous of me hanging out with Pressida. Just a bit, which makes me want Yue even more&hellip; 😀</p>

  <p>Oh boy. This day&hellip; Ok, so Yue and I had a tiny bit of a freak out moment about the CMD tests. I was so distraught after taking my tests today, but after spending some time with Yue, all of my worries just melted away. She is my natural anxiolytic! Well, <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/k3wGpp75gvhp6/giphy.gif">Yoda</a> <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/4ZYNlrSn7TTX2/giphy.gif">counts</a> <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/yPfQBsFmoQVUI/giphy.gif">too</a>. We are both considering the possibility of remediating. But together, we can make it.</p>

  <p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/bD4aSsZq3JWdG/giphy.gif">Yue is a beast</a>. She was in focus mode all weekend. I could definitely see the effort she is placing into studying. Such hard work better pay off! I was so proud of her today. In the zone, locked and loaded with no time for interruptions. That&rsquo;s what I like to see. Proper prioritization. Plus, she looks cute when she is focused.</p>

  <p>Today was a good day. Started out very stressful with waking up super early in the morning to cram for a test, but it ended with <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/5CGHc2q51s3AI/giphy.gif">some nice relaxing time with Yue</a>. With the pressure of the finals, I forgot how it felt like to take the time for some of the little things.</p>

  <p>Yue is seeing Professor Erdman about her grades for CMD. I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t realize it was troubling her&hellip; troubling her to the point of seeing Professor Erdman. I feel bad for not noticing this issue earlier! I felt like a shitty boyfriend. I should review materials with her. Oh and I was really proud of her for <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/uiZ3H26ye8C2VhfrB1/giphy.gif">focusing</a> on studying the whole day. No distractions. Almost like a student hopped up on caffeine cramming for the most important test of her life. Almost&hellip;</p>

  <p>Today I felt like I was loved. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/auGFCmg6rM0eI/giphy.gif">Genuinely loved</a> by another human being. Yue has spent her very limited time in driving me around from campus to my apartment. And she is doing that with a sense of appreciation and I think only someone who truly loves me can have. Oh my, I am in trouble&hellip; 😀</p>

  <p>So I had a patient today in front of a few people. It didn’t really go well. I kept getting nervous and my flow was not good at all. I was quite disappointed and pretty upset, but Yue&rsquo;s presence cured me of my afflictions. BTW that’s the most sophisticated sentence I will ever write. She is my <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/dJGYFScvBjfRabiH7m/giphy.gif">natural anxiolytic</a>. 😀</p>

  <p>So this is my very first attempt at keeping a journal. I am pretty sure this is going to be a pretty rough journal. Not sure how long I can keep this going, but I am going to try to log something interesting about us in here. Plan is to make this into a website and surprise Yue. And <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/A3t48v7vgzk1G/giphy.gif">I am no good with words</a>, so Yue, this is an apology in advance.</p>

<p>Today, I found out Yue was keeping a journal. I am totally surprised. I love her even more. I had an idea that was similar to hers - makes me think we are so much compatible!</p>
